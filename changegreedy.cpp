/**************************************************************
 * *  Function name: change greedy 
 * *  Parameters: Vector of coin set, int representing V, Vector of coin counts
 * *  Return value: Returns sum of coin count values representing minimum coins to make V change 
 * *  Description: Another approach to coin change problem is the greedy approach.  This implementation is called changegreedy.  
 * *  This is also “naive” since it may not be optimal.
